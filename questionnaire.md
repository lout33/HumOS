### **Your HumOS Profile: Let's Get Started!**

**Welcome!** This questionnaire is designed to help you create your very own HumOS Profile. Think of it as a personal guidebook that helps you understand yourself better and makes working with others (and AI!) easier and more effective.

**How to fill it out:**
*   **Be honest and thoughtful:** The more detail you provide, the more helpful your profile will be. Try to provide specific examples where possible.
*   **Take your time:** Some questions are quick, others might need a bit more reflection. No need to rush!
*   **It's a living document:** You can always come back and update your answers as you learn and grow.

**Your Privacy Matters:** Your answers are for you and will be used to create your HumOS Profile.

#### **SECTION 8: INTERACTION & AI COLLABORATION PREFERENCES**

**8.1. General Interaction Style & Environment**
*(Your answers here help define your general preferences for how you like to work and communicate, which can inform how AI assistants interact with you effectively.)*

*   **Communication Channels & Style:**
    *   What are your preferred communication channels for different types of interactions (e.g., email for detailed records, instant messaging for quick queries, calls for complex discussions)?
    *   Do you prefer formal or informal communication? Concise or detailed explanations?
    *   How might these preferences apply to interactions with an AI (e.g., voice commands, textual chat, visual dashboards, detailed reports vs. summaries)?
*   **Being Convinced:**
    *   What's the best way to convince you of an idea or approach, whether from a human or an AI (e.g., logical arguments backed by data/evidence, seeing a working prototype or simulation, understanding the "why" behind it, appeals to your core values [see 1.2], a clear cost/benefit analysis)?
*   **Feedback:**
    *   How do you prefer to give and receive feedback (e.g., direct and private, specific examples are crucial, solution-oriented, appreciate positive reinforcement as well as constructive points)?
    *   How should an AI deliver feedback, suggestions, or corrections to you for optimal reception?
*   **Energizing Work Conditions:**
    *   What kind of work conditions, team dynamics (if applicable to how AI might support your individual work within a team context), or interaction styles energize you (e.g., collaborative brainstorming bursts, long periods of deep focus, fast-paced and challenging, clear goals with autonomy, structured and predictable)?
    *   How can an AI help create or support such an environment for you (e.g., by managing notifications, structuring information, facilitating focus)?
*   **Exciting Projects & Challenges:**
    *   What types of projects, problems, or challenges genuinely excite and motivate you (e.g., solving complex, unsolved problems, creating something entirely new, projects with clear, tangible impact, opportunities for learning new skills on the job, optimizing existing systems)? (This helps AI understand your intrinsic motivations for tasks it might assist with).

**8.2. AI-Specific Interaction & Augmentation**
*(This section focuses directly on how you envision AI assisting you and your preferences for that interaction.)*

*   **Areas for AI Assistance:**
    *   In what specific tasks or areas would you like an AI to assist, augment, or automate your capabilities (e.g., "automating repetitive data entry," "summarizing research papers," "drafting initial email responses," "helping brainstorm creative ideas," "advanced data analysis and visualization," "creating personalized learning plans," "managing my schedule and reminders," "fact-checking information")?
*   **Ideal AI Assistant Features:**
    *   If you could design an "ideal AI assistant" for your work or personal life, what key features, capabilities, or personality traits would it have (e.g., "highly adaptive," "proactive but not intrusive," "excellent at explaining complex topics simply," "able to learn my specific jargon," "maintains conversational context over long periods," "transparent about its limitations")?
*   **Preferred AI Communication Style:**
    *   Beyond general preferences in 8.1, are there specific ways you want AI to communicate? (e.g., "Provide options instead of a single answer," "Always cite sources for factual claims," "Use bullet points for summaries," "Offer different levels of detail on request," "Explain its reasoning process if asked").
*   **Desired Level of AI Proactivity:**
    *   What level of proactivity do you prefer from an AI assistant (e.g., "Only respond to direct requests," "Offer suggestions based on current context/task," "Proactively manage certain pre-defined tasks without prompting," "Alert me to potential issues or opportunities it identifies based on my profile and goals")?
*   **Handling of Information & Uncertainty:**
    *   How should an AI handle sensitive information from your profile?
    *   How should an AI communicate when it's uncertain about an answer or cannot fulfill a request?
*   **Error Correction & Learning:**
    *   How do you prefer an AI to handle instances where it makes a mistake or you need to correct it? (e.g., "Acknowledge error and ask for clarification," "Offer to remember the correction for future interactions").
